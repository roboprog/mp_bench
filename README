Welcome to mp_bench

This package attempts to benchmark several language implementations
in a multiprocessor / multi CPU environment,
and in particular using threading and fork.
Fork doesn't work well under Windows (depite POSIX layer),
so I've not put any effort there.

This benchmark focus on churning strings around,
*not* on numberic operations or other low level bit twiddling.
